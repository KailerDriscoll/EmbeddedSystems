Coursework from ECEN 2270: Embedded System creating firmware for a Silicon Labs Thunderboard Sense 2 microprocessor board.

The code for this board was written in C, utilizing methods of modularity and encapsulation to create efficient and well-structured code.

Uploaded is the source code of the final project, which was an accumulation of the assignments during the semester. Functionally, the code allows the board (connected to a bluetooth module) to communicate with a phone and send messages to the phone at a rate controlled by the phone.
